Last year, we shared our dream of [hosting the first-ever Open Source Festival in Africa](https://blog.oscafrica.org/announcing-open-source-festival-2020-ck1hwf1mf00fl0ms1ntuk35ha) with you, and we have since made tremendous progress with your support and excitement.

The Open Source Festival is a high profile event that would attract student delegates, developers, designers, and corporate organizations on a large scale with series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced developer tools. The maiden edition is going to be a forum for networking, discussions, and ideas proration around the latest happenings in technology as well as the growth of open source in Africa.

Through this festival, we intend to move Africans from just the billion users to the NEXT BILLION CREATORS.

Here are a few grand updates we have for you:

## Sustain Africa Summit

Sustain Summit is a one-day conversation for Open Source Software Sustainers. We would be talking about **Sustainability - the sustainability of resources and the sustainability of its people**.

At the Sustain Africa summit, there would be no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos. Your undivided attention will be required. Phones and laptops will not be used throughout, and you will be asked to put devices away if they are a distraction to you or anyone else, as facilitators take you through the journey of Open Source Sustainability.
