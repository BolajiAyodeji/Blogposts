## Introducing GitHub Community Health Files

Hey! This article is going to be very short and unstyled. My goal here is to introduce this feature I find very helpful to those who haven't heard of it and probably fill up the SEO space for those searching for it.

GitHub recently introduced a new feature that allows you to create default files like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, or even ISSUES templates in a public organization. These default files will be used for any repository owned by the organization that does not contain its file of that type. So if you have open-sourced projects in your company, project, or personal GitHub organization, then this is for you!

All you have to do is create a `.github` repository and put all the files and templates in it (here's a [perfect example](https://github.com/commercelayer/.github)). Then, you can find all the supported files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types) in the GitHub docs. I've also attached a screenshot below to save you some time (but feel free to click the link above to learn more about how to set up health files properly on GitHub). Cheers! ðŸ’™
