## Hashnode Series: The what and how!

Hello Awesome Hashnoders, ðŸ‘‹

If you have been reading the [She Inspires Series](https://hashnode.com/series/she-inspires-cjt0d02lq001e7ps2wo420g15) on Hashnode, you must have already noticed that each interview is published on a single thread-like page, well it's called Series.

Some of our amazing users have asked for the "Hashnode Series" feature already and for a few months now, we've been testing it in beta and now we are certain that it is ready to be made public.  

We officially introduce you to **Hashnode Series**!

Hashnode Series allows you to start a sequence of related articles and have them all in one place like the [She Inspires Series](https://hashnode.com/series/she-inspires-cjt0d02lq001e7ps2wo420g15).

Some knowledge cannot be shared in just one article and hence the need of **Series** where you can write many related articles and have them under one page. You can start a series of articles like: "Demystifying GraphQL", "JavaScript for Beginners", "Let's build 50 ReactNative apps in 50 days" and so much more. Just think of a topic, create a series and start writing.

## GETTING STARTED
Using Hashnode series is simple and stress-free, if you're a Hashnoder already, then it will be much easier as you should be familiar with the user interface already.
