## Open Source Festival 2020: Updates and Highlights

Last year, we shared our dream of [hosting the first-ever Open Source Festival in Africa](https://blog.oscafrica.org/announcing-open-source-festival-2020-ck1hwf1mf00fl0ms1ntuk35ha) with you, and we have since made tremendous progress with your support and excitement.

The Open Source Festival is a high profile event that would attract student delegates, developers, designers, and corporate organizations on a large scale with series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced developer tools. The maiden edition is going to be a forum for networking, discussions, and ideas proration around the latest happenings in technology as well as the growth of open source in Africa.

Through this festival, we intend to move Africans from just the billion users to the NEXT BILLION CREATORS.

Here are a few updates we have for you:

## Sustain Africa Summit

With our partnership with [sustainOSS](https://sustainoss.org/), we're bringing the first Sustain Summit to Africa. 

Sustain Summit is a one-day conversation for Open Source Software Sustainers. We would be talking about **Sustainability - the sustainability of resources and the sustainability of its people**.

The conversation around the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized, and providing a roadmap for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open source project maintainers continues to be the focus of Sustain. It will be expressing discussed at the #SustainAfrica summit at the Open Source Festival.

At the Sustain Africa summit, there would be no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos. Your undivided attention will be required. Phones and laptops will not be used throughout, and you will be asked to put devices away if they are a distraction to you or anyone else, as facilitators take you through the journey of Open Source Sustainability.

**Who should attend?**

- Maintainers who manage contributions and take responsibility for the quality and governance of their projects,
- Contributors​ who contribute their time and experience to a project and
- Consumers​ or users who utilize a project to achieve their own goals.
- The sustainer​, the individual or organization that is concerned with the fragile state and future of highly-used and impactful open source projects.
 
Sustaining free and open-source software is more important than ever - and more realistic. We're gathering technologists, economists, maintainers, and hackers to discuss the New Hope for free and open-source software on a one day summit alongside the Open Source Festival.
