## Image Optimization and Transformation with Cloudinary

The web is now dominated with more visual content than ever hence the need to consider ways of delivering these images with the smallest possible file size while maintaining optimal visual quality.
> The less file size, the faster the browser can download and render the image. The optimal visual quality, the more satisfied your users will be.

This, therefore, leads to better user experience, increased retention and conversion rate, and user satisfaction.

There are many existing techniques and algorithms used to enhance and optimize images already but in this article, I'll introduce you to an amazing technique (based on my opinion and experience) which would help you better enhance and serve your media assets using a cloud-based image and video management platform.

## The Web Now

Original Images are often created with the original extra-high resolution to ensure optimal visual quality thereby resulting in high file size. This would lead to images delivered slowly when used in web pages. Not cool right?

So how then do we deliver images on the web with optimal speed and optimal visual quality?

## The Need for Optimization

The web is filled with tons of images, virtually every website on the internet has more than one image. Image Optimization simply means the process of delivering high-quality images in the right format, dimension, size, and resolution while keeping the smallest possible size.

According to [Kissmetrics](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/), 47 % of users expect a page to load in 2 seconds or less and users will abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.. This will drastically reduce your conversion rate (Amount of visitors turned into users).

> The conversion rate is the number of conversions divided by the total number of visitors. For example, if an e-commerce site receives 200 visitors in a month and has 50 sales, the conversion rate would be 50 divided by 200, or 25%. ~ [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/conversion-rate/)

Optimizing Images will:

- Improve page load speed
- Improve user experience
- Improve SEO ranking 

The faster your website loads images, the faster your website loads, the better your SEO ranking becomes, the better your user experience becomes, the more users interact with your website/ product, the increased your conversion rates become. It's a win-win, satisfy your users and increase your conversion rates.

## Introducing Cloudinary

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) is the market leader in providing a comprehensive cloud-based image and video management platform. Cloudinary is being used by hundreds of thousands of users around the world, from small startups to large enterprises. ~ [Cloudinary About Page](https://cloudinary.com/about)

For better understanding, this is how Cloudinary image optimization works:

- Upload your image(s) to their service
- You get a CDN URL for the image
- Apply transformations (if you want) to optimize the images
- Load your image via the URL
- Bingo! you have optimized image(s)

Whenever you apply any transformation to an image, Cloudinary performs the following optimizations by default:

- Strips all associated metadata from the transformed image file (the original image is left untouched).
- Applies an automatic quality adjustment to generated WebP, GIF, JPEG, and JPEG-XR formats.
- Runs optimization algorithms to minimize the file size without impairing the visual quality when generating images in the PNG, JPEG or GIF format.

## Getting Started

The process of getting your images on Cloudinary is pretty quick but before I show you how-to, let's roll through one fact that this is a PAID SERVICE :).

Chill, there is a FREE plan for developers and businesses but with limitations (limited credits: sort of internet data bytes for using Cloudinary services)

With the FREE plan, you get 25 credits. 1 Credit equals 1000 transformations or 1GB of managed storage or 1GB of monthly viewing bandwidth or 500 SD video processing seconds or 250 HD video processing seconds.

For now, you don't need to worry about PAID plans, but as your images and it's bandwidth increase, your credits get maxed out and you will need to upgrade to either the Plus ($89/m) or Advanced plan ($224/m).

Compare all the plans and pricing [here](https://cloudinary.com/pricing), you might actually want to upgrade earlier if you need the features of the paid plans.
