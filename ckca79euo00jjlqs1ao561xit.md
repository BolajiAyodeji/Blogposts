## Getting Started with WeJapa - An Overview and Practical Guide

Three months ago, [we launched WeJapa](https://japa4work.com/wejapa-your-job-search-ends-here-ck9l2hfw7009ccss1irph2akk) to simplify the entire job-hunting process, making it easier to find jobs, apply and relocate to locations outside your home country for work and so far it's been amazing.

WeJapa is a Talent-as-a-service company that provides highly sought-after opportunities for African techies and in the few months of our launch, we've connected 20+ vetted technical professionals with freelance, part-time and full-time job opportunities in several regions across the world.

In this article, I'll take you through a tour of the WeJapa application for Android, iOS and Web. We will cover all the prerequisites you need to get started and land a job via WeJapa. Let's get started? ðŸ™ƒ

### STEP TWO

The signup page will display now. Enter your details as requested in the form.

![WeJapa Mobile App.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593870789694/ALflDjwR2.png)

- Your full name (e.g Favour Dollars)
- Your email address (e.g favour@hey.com)
- Your phone number with country code (e.g +2348109346573)
- A link to your GitHub account, portfolio or website (e.g **[https://github.com/bolajiayodeji](https://github.com/bolajiayodeji)** or **[https://dribble.com/favourori](https://dribble.com/favourori)** or **[https://favourori.com](https://favourori.com)**)

> Please **resist the urge** to submit a link to a GitHub account with no or inactive repositories. Your GitHub account should contain all past and current projects you have worked on.

> We will use this to review your technical abilities and strengths. If you don't have any repository or your repositories are private, please consider submitting your portfolio instead.

- A link to your StackOverflow account. This is optional but necessary if you have an active account.
- A link to your Resume that is publicly accessible on the internet

> Based on past applications we have reviewed, a lot of applicants added a link to their resume which were not publicly accessible and this led to their applications being rejected. Do not be too eager to *Japa*, treat your application with optimum care. If you're not sure what to do, here are some options you can consider:

 > - Host your resume on your portfolio website or a free hosting platform like [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Upload the **resume.pdf** file to your host server, which can then be accessed via `https://yourdomain.com/resume.pdf`

 > - Host your resume file in one of your GitHub repositories and add a link to the resume RAW file.

 > - Upload your Resume to third-party file hosting platforms like: [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), [DropBox](http://dropbox.com), [Notion](http://notion.so), [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com), [Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) and others. By default your uploaded files will be private to you alone or any other email you add to the file. Create a shared link and **ensure to make the shared link public** before adding it to your application.

- Select your work experience level from the dropdown field (Junior: 1 - 2 years, Mid-level: 3 - 5 years and Senior level: > 5 years).

### STEP THREE

Click the button with the arrow label once you complete the form and you'll be redirected to a new page where you'll enter your new password with a minimum of 6 characters. This password will be used to authenticate your account when logging in via any WeJapa app.

Click the checkbox below the input field to agree to our [Terms of service](https://www.wejapa.com/terms) and finally click the button with the arrow label again.

### STEP FOUR

After this, you have successfully applied to become a WeJapan. We will email you to notify you about the success of your application and begin reviewing your application.

Reviews usually take 5 - 7 business working days but we will ensure to give you feedback on your application if you get **accepted** or **rejected**.
