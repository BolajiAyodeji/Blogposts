## DevCLokoja Events May - June 2020

The current global pandemic has brought several shifts to how we perceive life, interact, work and communicate. While this is going well for some, it's a nightmare for others and possibly a combination of both for some.

We have put together some events and virtual engagements to support members of DevCLokoja during these trying times. These are the event plans and budget we have for the next seven weeks in the first half of 2020 from 11th May 2020 - June 2020.


## Program One (#7WeeksOfCode)

Last year November (2019), we [announced the first #DevCLokoja30DaysofCode challenge](https://facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/permalink/2564914083584282/) for members of Facebook Developer Circle Lokoja to help members improve their programming skills or get started in programming by learning and writing code for 30 days in a row and get rewarded for their efforts (Here is the [report](https://devclokoja.hashnode.dev/devclokoja30daysofcode-season-i-recap-ck5pglsff0639qps1i39r8jh4) from the first season).

We would be continuing this program by extending it to 7 weeks learning challenge where DevCLokoja members can improve their programming skills or get started in programming by learning and writing code for seven weeks in a row and get rewarded for their efforts.

Members will choose a category to learn from, and we would provide a recommended list of FREE tutorials and resources members during these seven weeks and engage them daily with motivation, more resources and tips.

This challenge starts on 11TH MAY 2020 and ends on the 22ND JUNE 2020.
