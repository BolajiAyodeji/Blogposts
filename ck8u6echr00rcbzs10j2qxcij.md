## Women of DevC Lokoja IWD Celebration 2020 - Recap


[Developer Circles from Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/) is a program designed to create locally organized communities for developers. These communities are meant to educate and provide a forum for discussion and knowledge sharing around topics that are top-of-mind for developers in a particular market. 

To build upon the United Nation’s official International Women’s Day theme in 2020 “#EachforEqual” We hosted an International Women's Day event aimed at celebrating women in various roles in the tech space. The event was originally scheduled to hold physically, but due to the evolving public health concerns related to COVID-19, we decided to cancel the Women of DevC Lokoja - IWD Celebration physical event. Meanwhile, we hosted the event virtually via Zoom and Google Meets (a remote video conferencing app).

From the over 200k DevC members in our Circles worldwide, only 20% are female. We want to focus on increasing female membership and interest in tech not only during IWD’s month but year-round by starting conversations within the community to discuss these challenges that female members face. The focus of this event was to celebrate women in various roles in the tech space and help others not in the space see reasons why they should and how they can get started.

## How did it go?

On 28th March 2020, we had our first virtual event at Facebook Developer Circle: Lokoja to celebrate the International Women’s Day 2020. We originally planned to record the entire event (which we did) and upload to YouTube but due to some disruptions we experienced on the call, the record audio and quality was disrupted hence we won't be uploading to YouTube anymore :(. Meanwhile, some speakers pre-recorded their talk and we have attached them to this article alongside resources and slides from other speakers.
