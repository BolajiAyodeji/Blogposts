## Facebook Developer Circles Lokoja - Launch Event 2019

Developer Circles from Facebook is a program designed to create locally organized communities for developers. These communities are meant to educate and provide a forum for discussion and knowledge sharing around topics that are top-of-mind for developers in a particular market. 

## Why join a circle?
Whatever you build, Developer Circles connects you to collaborate, learn, and code with other local developers.
You get to attend local meetups, collaborate in Facebook Groups and learn about the latest Facebook technologies.

[Facebook Developer Circle: Lokoja](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/) is a forum for developers in Lokoja, Kogi state and its surroundings who are interested in building on the Facebook platform to interact and collaborate with other developers who share similar interests.

## Bringing Developers Together

On 31st August 2019, we officially launched the circle with the first meetup.  
The focus of this meetup was to introduce members of the community to Developer Circle, its goals, mission and importance to their career growth alongside introducing them to some Facebook technologies and how they can utilize these tools in modern-day development.

We had someone from the [Facebook](https://facebook.com) team join us remotely to have a pep talk with our attendees alongside our firebrand speakers from [Andela Nigeria](https://andela.com), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) and [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io).

## Highlights and Attendee Feedbacks

> everyone who made today's program a success,  I say thank you. 
I have been confused for a while about what programming language to learn, where to start, how to go about it, why I should learn a particular one and whether it will still be relevant in the nearest foreseeable future. But thanks to today's program my part has been made clear before me. I say a big thanks to the organizers of today's Dev.C meet up.
