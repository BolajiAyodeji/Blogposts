## The JavaScript Workshop 2020 - Recap

Developer Circles from Facebook is a program designed to create locally organized communities for developers. These communities are meant to educate and provide a forum for discussion and knowledge sharing around topics that are top-of-mind for developers in a particular market. 

## The JavaScript Workshop

On 25th January 2020, we had our first event and workshop at Facebook Developer Circle: Lokoja.

We have decided to start language-specific, beginner-focused, practical, and interactive workshops at DevCLokoja and for a couple of months in 2020. We would be running several of these workshops to equip members of the community with solid technical skills.

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language.

The JavaScript Workshop focuses on building up your practical skills by introducing you to programming concepts using JavaScript so that you can learn how to develop cutting-edge cross-platform applications. We also had diverse lighting talks after the workshop.
