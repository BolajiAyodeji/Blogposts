There’s no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real-world tools can be pretty expensive. That’s why GitHub created the **GitHub Student Developer Pack** to give **students** **free access** to the **best developer tools** in one place so they can **learn by doing**. In this article, I’d take you through the GitHub Student Developer Pack and show you how to apply for it.

## What is GitHub Student Developer Pack?

[GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) offers students real-world experience with free access to various developer tools from GitHub’s partners. This pack gives you free access to various tools that world-class developers use. The pack contains 70+ tools ranging from Data Science, Gaming, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, APIs, Integrated Development Environments, Version Control Systems, Cloud Hosting Platforms, Code Tutorials, BootCamps, Continuous Integration Platforms, and lots more.

> If your company produces developer tools and wants to be included in the Pack, you can [pass a note to GitHub](https://github.com/contact) and get it added to the pack.

## How to Apply for the Pack

To be eligible for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you must:

* Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study
* Have a verifiable school-issued email address or school documents that prove your current student status
* Have a [GitHub user
account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
* Be at least 13 years old

If you meet the above requirements, you can [apply for the GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application?utm_source=bolajiayodeji-content). Once your GitHub Student Developer Pack access expires, you may reapply if you’re still eligible. However, some of the tools are not renewable, as some offers from GitHub partners cannot be renewed.

## Conclusion

The GitHub Student Developer Pack helps you as a student to ship software like a professional. Ensure you **learn by doing**; use these tools to improve and advance your skills. Be creative; these tools would allow you to build and develop the future at no cost, build brilliant innovations and make the world better.
