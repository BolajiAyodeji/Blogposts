the **GitHub Student Developer Pack** to give **students** **free access** to
the **best developer tools** in one place so they can **learn by doing**.

## Terms and Conditions

* Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study
* Have a verifiable school-issued email address or school documents that prove your current student status
* Have a [GitHub user
account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)

## How to apply for the pack

If you meet the above requirements, you can apply for the GitHub Student
Developer Pack, which includes offers and benefits from GitHub partners.

**[1]. Visit the application website**

* Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) and, in the top right,
click Join GitHub Education.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*U1gVH0ALuTfGG0zc.png)

* Under “Which best describes your academic status?”, select Student.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VcckIjBRe5Z78Dk5.png)

**[2]. Verification process**

There are two ways to verify your student status, a verifiable school-issued
email address or school documents that prove your current student status e.g
(**Admission letter, Departmental receipts, Faculty letters, School grants
receipts and others)**

> Selecting a school-issued email address, if you have one, gives you the best
> chance of a speedy review. Although the second method takes a little more time,
it would still get verified. If you reside in Nigeria and attend a Federal or
State University, you would have to consider the second method otherwise you can
use the first.

* Select or add the email address you use for school.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zUP1Iptj4mwf9MGP.png)

* Upload proof of your academic status if you do not have a school-issued email
address

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*i542b4wazxZ8J913.png)

> PDF files are not supported, and you cannot upload them as proof of academic
> status. Upload in image format (e.g .png, .jpg, .jpeg)

* Enter your school’s name.
* Describe how you plan to use GitHub.

> This is just to check if you truly know the worth of the pack. Briefly state
> what you need the pack for and how you would use it.

* **Verify your application details**, then click **Submit your information.**

> If your application is approved, you’ll receive a confirmation email.
> Applications are usually processed within a few days, but it may take longer
during peak times, such as during the start of a new semester. I got mine within
32 hours :)
