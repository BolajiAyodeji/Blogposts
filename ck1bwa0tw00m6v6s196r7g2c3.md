## Introducing Hashnode Channels

Hello Awesome Hashnoders, 👋

If you are active on Hashnode, you must have already noticed a new blue navbar with interesting topics on the top of your homepage.   

We realized that people write "technical contents" only on Hashnode and they miss out from other amazing contents they would have written or read about.  
We have therefore introduced streamlined feeds for topics that matter to developers the most and we are calling them “Hashnode Channels.”

We are committed to make Hashnode a go-to developer community for sharing knowledge, and this is one of the first few steps.

Hashnode Channels are streamlined feeds for 5 interesting types of content on Hashnode:

## [💻 My Feed](https://hashnode.com/)

A feed that displays posts that are relevant to you. Our algorithm uses Collaborative Filtering to decide which posts you are likely to read. It detects what developers similar to you on Hashnode are reading and interacting with and prioritizes them on your feed. You’ll now see posts that are more related to you.

You can also see posts chronologically, select “See recent posts instead” from the sorter bar on top of your feed. You will see all the recent posts (from all the topics on Hashnode) without any personalization.

## [💼 #WhoisHiring](https://hashnode.com/feed/whoishiring)

As Developers, not everyone can understand our issues, frustrations or jokes.
This channel is a safe place to escape from your stressful and busy lives. Here, you can share and bond over other developers' successes and frustrations with code, tech and life as a programmer.

## [🎓 #TIL](https://hashnode.com/feed/til)

A short form of "Today I Learned". As a developer, we learn something new every day. In this channel, you can share something you learnt today, share your daily learning progress with the community, share interesting and specific facts about programming languages, tools, libraries, or something that you are using at work.
