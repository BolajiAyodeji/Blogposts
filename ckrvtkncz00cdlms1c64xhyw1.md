## Announcing the Open Source Challenge 2021

Open Source Software (OSS) is software whose source code or documentation, or designs are made available for use, modification, or enhancement by **anyone in the world**. Did you notice that it says "anyone in the world" and not "only software engineers"? That's because anybody, including **you**, can contribute to an open-source project. 

Contributing to Open Source Software is a catalyst for growth; it can open you up to many opportunities like personal career growth, technical experience, a job or paid gig, and connections with people doing amazing things all over the world.

We want you to become better at contributing to open-source and enjoy its many benefits. Hence we created the **Open Source Challenge** aimed at supporting **you** to contribute to open-source projects ðŸ”¥.

## The Open Source Challenge by OSCA

The Open Source Challenge 2021 aims to support the tech ecosystem in Africa to contribute to open source projects. Each participant records open source contributions made by submitting links to merged pull requests. At the end of the challenge, the top 20 contributors get rewarded with internet data to support their learning/work and a digital certificate that they can add to their collection or resume.

We'll be hosting a webinar about the challenge on August 7th, 2021, to kick-start the challenge. Kindly register to attend the webinar [here](https://opencollective.com/osca/events/open-source-challenge-2021-webinar-9dc4b5b0). Come learn more about the challenge and ask us any questions.
