I'm officially back in the job market and hunting for my next gig! I'm keeping an open mind about the type of company and technology industry I'd like to work with next; however, I'm looking for a full-time **Developer Advocate**, **Developer Relations Engineer**, **Developer Experience Engineer**, **Solutions Engineer**, **Technical Writer**, **Documentation Engineer**, or other similar developer/customer success roles with a strong focus on technical integrations (JavaScript/Python), developer relations/education, documentation, content production/marketing, and developer programs/community/customer management.

I will spend the next months hunting for new opportunities, interviewing, exploring new stuff, doing some open-source work, and shipping new content. I've had quite some projects on my backlog that I didn't get to yet, and I'd use the extra free time I have now to get to some of them. This includes revamping a couple of old OSS projects, open-sourcing some private repos, sharing my knowledge through new content on my blog, continuing to run my [newsletter](https://bawd.bolajiayodeji.com), finally starting to create/edit technical educational videos for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/bolajiayodeji), upskilling in different capacities, and maybe live streaming Chess with a couple of acquaintances/strangers. The next couple of weeks will be an exciting roller coaster for me, and I look forward to seeing how it turns out.

## A little about me

I’m a Software Engineer (focusing on JavaScript/Python web engineering, data, and embedded systems—Raspberry Pi mainly), Content Creator, Teacher, and Developer Advocate with five (5) years of professional working experience.

I’m very passionate about sharing knowledge, educating people about technology and helping them become better at what they do. I do this by writing technical articles on my blog, running a weekly newsletter, building open-source projects, organizing/speaking at meetups/conferences, and building technical communities. Being able to solve problems systematically and efficiently is my greatest strength. Using a hands-on technical approach paired with strong communication and management skills, I collaborate with people, establish and lead teams, professionally develop support, enhance operations, and manage information systems, communities, and solutions.

As a developer advocate, I've spent the last years working with outstanding teams, building great developer and API products. This developer relations career portfolio will show you why I would be a valuable addition to your company.

## Why you should hire me

Here are a few reasons that make me a great addition to your team:

* I'm keen on doing my best in any responsibility assigned to me. It's a personal principle; I always strive to do my best on any given task using all that is available to me and iterate deliverables based on feedback.
    
* I enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge. This is the foundation of my developer relations/education strengths and my entire career.
    
* I can adapt to new conditions, company goals/visions, go-to-market strategy requirements, and the overall business needs of your developer product.
    
* I'm an honest person and don't tell lies. I won't tell developers that your product is the best in the world (unless proven), but I will take my time to understand the key strengths/benefits/limitations of your product and scream the benefits to developers at the top of my voice, show them how those benefits offer them value, help them get comfortable with building with your product, and build a trust relationship with them.
    
* I have solid experience working with and leading developer communities since my teenage years, with some notable ones being [Meta Developer Circles](https://github.com/fbdevelopercircles) (previously Facebook Developers Circles), [GitHub Education Campus Expert](https://education.github.com/experts), and [Open Source Community Africa](https://oscafrica.org).
    
* I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. While this is usually not an essential determinant for most companies, it is valuable to me. I spent quite some years acquiring theoretical, practical, and research knowledge that impacts some of my current strengths and interests (especially around Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Electronics, and Embedded Systems).
    
* Aside from my years of solid technical writing experience, I also have some experience with academic research writing and published my first paper on [Performance and Accessibility Evaluation of University Websites in Nigeria](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10051461) in the 2022 5th Information Technology for Education and Development (ITED). I'm currently working on publishing my second research paper for my undergraduate dissertation.
    
* I'm mostly humorous, and people enjoy working with me :).
    

---

My key strengths are:

* Writing code for things that work on the web using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python programming languages.
    
* Writing code for things that work on embedded systems using Python programming language, OpenCV, and other related libraries.
    
* API documentation.
    
* Technical content creation.
    
* Content production/marketing.
    
* Community/programs management.
    
* Developer events organizing.
    
* Educational programs management.
    
* Educational curriculum development.
    
* Memes collection and efficient distribution :).
    

---

As your next Developer Advocate or Developer Experience Engineer, I will bring my software engineering and developer relations experience to:

* Stand as a mediator between your product and developers using the products—helping them be successful with your product offerings.
    
* Talk to your prospective technical or non-technical customers in different engineering teams and help them understand the value of your product.
    
* Build tools, code demos, integrations, content, educational materials, and documentation to ensure developers can fully utilize your products.
    
* Work with strategic partners to show the power of your product when composed with other tools and services developers love (including both open-sourced and commercial) by building brilliant/creative integration ideas and templates.
    
* Educate developers on your product via open-source, public speaking/technical workshops at conferences or local developer meetups, documentation, and published tutorials/videos.
    
* Lead conversations around the latest technology advancements and best practices around and outside your product in the developer community at in-person events, online events, or social forums.
    
* Build, grow, and nurture a community of developers who use your product.
    
* Work closely and collaborate with your engineering, product, marketing, sales, customer success, and other existing internal teams to improve your product's developer experience.
    
* Test your new product features and give early feedback that will aid improvements.
    
* Gather feedback from the developer community on old/new product features for further planning, prioritization, and shipping.
    
* Track and measure the success and failure of the activities and responsibilities you assign to me, showing the business value of Developer Relations at your company.

### Courses:

I organized a [Software Engineering BootCamp](https://tau.edu.ng/news-page.php?i=75&a=tau-taico-to-host-maiden-software-engineering-bootcamp) at [Thomas Adewumi University](https://tau.edu.ng) in 2022 for their university and high school students that introduced them to key areas of Software Engineering, such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Full-stack Web Development. Aside from organizing and managing the entire BootCamp/Curriculum, I taught the Anatomy of the Web and Version Control class.

Although not publicly visible (only visible to registered students), I partnered with [AltSchool Africa](https://altschoolafrica.com) in the past to teach an **Introduction to Open Source and Version Control with Git and GitHub** course for their [School of Engineering](https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering) Class of 22” and will potentially be used in the Class of 23". I have since received good feedback from students who took the course (most of which were verbal, but you can find some written ones below).

### Extra community and open-source contributions:

I'm currently a core team member and the community manager for [Open Source Community Africa](https://oscafrica.org), a community for open source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates and experts within and across Africa with the sole aim of increasing the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects both locally and globally. I manage the digital community on Discord of 4000+ members, co-organizing and facilitating virtual community events, managing communications via newsletters and blog posts, preparing fiscal year budgets, preparing community/event data visualization/reports, facilitating community partnerships with companies like GitHub, SustainOSS, Propel, TalentQL, etc., supporting community members to participate in OSS programs like Hacktoberfest, GSOC, GSOD, Outreachy, etc., and running the [Chapters program](https://oscafrica.org/community) that spans 30+ chapters in three continents of Africa. Over the years, we have had commendable community growth and results of members contributing to OSS, creating OSS, and advancing their careers.

I have also been co-organizing the yearly [Open Source Festival](https://festival.oscafrica.org) and [Sustain Africa](https://festival.oscafrica.org/sustain-africa) with other core team and committee members for three years now. The festival is a conference that attracts student delegates, developers, designers and corporate organizations on a large scale with a series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced developer tools (the biggest of its kind in Africa and Nigeria). Sustain, on the other hand, is a one-day conversation for open-source maintainers and contributors where we talk about Sustainability—the sustainability of resources and the sustainability of its people, the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized with the aim of providing a roadmap for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open-source project maintainers. We're currently working on 2023's report, but you can [read that of 2022](https://blog.oscafrica.org/sustain-africa-2022-community-report) to learn more.

I also actively contribute to [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev), where best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open-source software are created. I worked last on the [Installation Guide Template](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/tree/main/installation-guide) alongside a partner in the [Capilano release](https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/releases/v1.0.0), and I'm currently working on an API Use Cases Template.
