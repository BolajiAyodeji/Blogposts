## Open Source Festival 2022: Updates and Highlights

Last two years, we hosted the [first-ever Open Source Festival in Africa](https://blog.oscafrica.org/the-chronicles-of-open-source-festival-2020) and have since then grown tremendously as a community supporting the open-source movement within Africa. Well, as you might have heard, it's happening again!!! üîú 

At Open Source Community Africa, we intend to help integrate the act of open source contribution to African developers while strongly advocating the movement of free and open-source software (FOSS). Every year, we host our maiden Open Source Festival, a high-profile event that attracts student delegates, developers, designers, and corporate organizations on a large scale with a series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced developer tools. The second edition will be a forum for networking, discussions, and ideas proration around the latest happenings in technology and the growth of open source in Africa. Through this festival, we intend to open the eyes of Africans so they can be aware that the FUTURE IS OPEN.

## Sustain Africa Summit 2022

Sustain Africa is a one-day **invite-only** conversation for Open Source Software Sustainers. We would be talking about Sustainability - the sustainability of resources and the sustainability of its people. The conversation around the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized, and providing a roadmap for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open source project maintainers continues to be the focus of Sustain.

Our overall goals at Sustain Africa are to:

1. Map and compare visions for the long-term health of free and open software communities around the globe. Connecting those who are passionate about these topics and supporting deeper ongoing collaboration and shared practice.
2. Frame and workshop concrete sustainability needs and challenges, applying and prototyping strategies and practices that provide ongoing support and leadership in sustainability practices.
3. Document models, strategies, and approaches to sustainability of OSS projects and work toward a more sustainable future for OSS.
4. Address the ‚Äúhard conversations‚Äù tied to sustainability, including appropriate practices for companies participating in free and open communities and new developments in licensing and reuse.
