## OSCALagos Give Back Weekend Recap.

> Open Source Community Africa is a community for open-source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates and experts within and across Africa with the sole aim of increasing the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects both locally and globally, changing the perception of Africans from just the billion users to the NEXT BILLION CREATORS.

----

We use a lot of open-source tools, we have freely received and would want to give back to the community by contributing to the products we use. Open Source Community Africa has decided to gather developers in a room to get the ball rolling on actually contributing to open source projects on GitHub ranging from documentation to code contributions.
On Saturday, August 3rd 2019, we held the OSCALagos meetup from 09:30 AM till 2:00 PM.
