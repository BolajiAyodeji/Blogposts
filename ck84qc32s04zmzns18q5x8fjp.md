At the Sustain Africa summit, there were no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos, and our amazing facilitators took us through the journey of Open Source Sustainability.

We had conversations around the comprehensive overview of how FOSS is developed, maintained, utilized, and providing a roadmap for solving the cultural, financial, and institutional issues among open source project maintainers.

![SUSTAIN2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1584283918527/MMKLmPF3s.png)

The program included a set of discussions and strategy sessions share-out designed to explore the latest practices and learnings around sustainability in OSS contexts with five interactive case studies:

- Approaches to raising funds for your open source project
- The role of documentation in sustainable FOSS projects (How to create and scale timely documentation)
- Design and Sustainability (Open Source Design)
- OSS Programs (GCI, GSOC, and GSOD as a means of gaining new contributors)
- Marketing (Practices for reaching people as a means of achieving sustainability)

Results from each session, inventory action items, next steps, and other bridges to post-event collaboration will be published soon by each facilitator, as discussed during the summit. Ensure to [subscribe to our newsletter](https://blog.oscafrica.org/) to get updated when this happens.
