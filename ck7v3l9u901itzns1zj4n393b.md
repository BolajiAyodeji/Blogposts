Last year, we shared our dream of [hosting the first-ever Open Source Festival in Africa](https://blog.oscafrica.org/announcing-open-source-festival-2020-ck1hwf1mf00fl0ms1ntuk35ha) with you, and we made it happen with your tremendous support and excitement.

The Open Source Festival is a high profile event that attracted student delegates, developers, designers, and corporate organizations on a large scale with series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced developer tools. The maiden edition was a forum for networking, discussions, and ideas proration around the latest happenings in technology as well as the growth of open source in Africa.

At the Sustain Africa summit, there were no keynotes, talks, or sponsor demos and our amazing facilitators took us through the journey of Open Source Sustainability.
