## Best Developer Communities to be part of in 2020

The benefits of developer communities cannot be over-emphasized in the growth of developers from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.

Communities are usually built on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the individual's collective needs.

Over the years, these developer communities have grown across the world with different goals and missions but still with the general aim of providing a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow.

## Conclusion

> "There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about." – Margaret J. Wheatley

The bond in developer communities has grown from just "technical groups" to "family groups" where everyone is passionate about sharing knowledge, giving back, and helping everyone reach higher heights.

Isn't this just amazing? Cheers to the new age where sharing knowledge and togetherness become the order of the day. 🙏💙
