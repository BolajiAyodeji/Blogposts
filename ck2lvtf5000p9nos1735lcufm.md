## Introducing Hashnode IRL with Hashnode IRL  Lagos, Nigeria! üéâüçï

Over the years, we have built a growing programming community for Developers learning how to code or willing to help others get started with programming.

At Hashnode, we are empowering developers to tell their stories and help them grow in their career and have brought together more than 500K+ monthly active developers from 180+ countries worldwide and we have decided to bring this passion and excitement that our amazing community share In Real Life.

We are starting locally-organized city-based events dedicated to sharing knowledge, learning new concepts, networking with each other and growing friendships IRL.
