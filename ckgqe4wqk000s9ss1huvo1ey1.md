## Career Update: Joining the Commerce Layer Team

Hey, awesome 👋,

I trust you're doing well and staying safe.

The past couple of weeks have been challenging and tiring from the fight against police brutality and protests to [#EndSars ✊🏾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_SARS) in Nigeria 🇳🇬. 

Amidst all the struggles, I'm excited to share some good news and announce that I have joined the distinguished team at [Commerce Layer](https://commercelayer.io) as a Developer Advocate.

## Quick Intro to Commerce Layer

Web development today has shifted from the traditional ways and is completely different from what it was a few years ago. Commerce Layer is a purely transactional engine based platform that integrates with any CMS of your choice, adding international shopping capabilities to ANY presentation layer — the perfect solution to build e-commerce on the JAMstack, providing the highest performance and reducing the cost of infrastructure.

As a headless commerce platform and order management system, Commerce Layer lets you add global shopping capabilities to any website, mobile app, chatbot, or IoT device, with ease via our commerce APIs.

## Okay?

I'm passionate about the JAMstack ecosystem and can't wait to do amazing stuff with the community of JAMstack and e-commerce developers at Commerce Layer. You'll find me creating, amplifying & looking for the right examples, messaging, and languages for audiences using our [developer's documentation](https://commercelayer.io/developers), [open-source project's](https://github.com/commercelayer), and a bunch of random DevRel stuff.

If you have any questions about Commerce Layer or any of our services, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iambolajiayo) or join our Slack by requesting an invite [here](https://commercelayer.io/developers).

Keep trailblazing, and stay safe! 💙
