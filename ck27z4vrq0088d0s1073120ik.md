## Iterating through JavaScript Objects  -  5 Techniques and Performance Tests

Developers tend to know how to iterate through JavaScript Arrays easily but most times they tend to get confused while working with JavaScript Objects especially beginners and intermediates. 
In this article, I’d show you Five (5) different ways of iterating through JavaScript Objects and some performance comparison tests to show you which is faster and more efficient.

### Property flags

Object properties, besides a `value`, have three special attributes (also known as “flags”):

* `writable` – if `true`, can be edited, else it's read-only.
* `enumerable` – if `true`, then listed in loops.
* `configurable` – if `true`, the property can be deleted and these attributes can
be modified.

When we create a property “the usual way”, all of them are `true`. But we can
change them anytime.

The method [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor](https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) allows us to query the *full* information about a property.

```
let user = {
  name: "Bolaji"
};
let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(user, 'name');
console.log(descriptor);
// {value: "Bolaji", writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true}
```

### **What does an enumerable property mean?**

**Enumerable properties** are those **properties** whose internal **enumerable**
flag is set to true, which is the default for **properties** created via simple
assignment.

Basically, if you create an object via `obj = {foo: 'bar'}` or something
thereabouts, all the properties are enumerable.

## for…in loop

The **for...in loop statement** can be used to iterate over all
non-[Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol),
[enumerable
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties)
of an object.

```
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3"
}
for (let key in obj) {
  let value = obj[key];
  console.log(key, value);
}
// key1 value1
// key2 value2
// key3 value3
```

## Object.keys

The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of Object keys. This creates an
array that contains the properties of the object. You can then loop through the
array to get the keys and values you need.

```
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3"
}
let items = Object.keys(obj);
console.log(items);
// ["key1", "key2", "key3"]
items.map(key => {
 let value = obj[key];
 console.log(key, value)
});
// key1 value1
// key2 value2
// key3 value3
```

## Object.values

The `Object.values()` method returns an array of Objects Values. This creates an
array that contains the properties of the object. You can then loop through the
array to get the keys and values you need.

```
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3"
}
let items = Object.values(obj);
console.log(items);
// ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
items.map(value => {
 console.log(value)
});
// value1
// value2
// value3
```

## Object.getOwnPropertyNames

The `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method returns an array of all properties
(including non-enumerable properties except for those which use Symbol) found
directly in a given object. This creates an array that contains the properties
of the object. You can then loop through the array to get the keys and values
you need.

```
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3"
}
let items = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj);
console.log(items);
// ["key1", "key2", "key3"]
items.map(key => {
 let value = obj[key];
 console.log(key, value)
});
// key1 value1
// key2 value2
// key3 value3
```

## Object.entries

The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object's own
enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs. 

```
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3"
}
let items = Object.entries(obj);
console.log(items);
// 0: ["key1", "value1"]
// 1: ["key2", "value2"]
// 2: ["key3", "value3"]
items.map(item => {
 let key = item[0];
 let value = item[1];
 console.log(key, value);
});
// key1 value1
// key2 value2
// key3 value3
```

## Performance Comparison

Now let's test all these techniques and compare each one based on their speed
and performance to determine which is faster and much efficient

Most browsers like Chrome and Firefox implement high-resolution timing in
`performance.now()`. The `performance.now()` method returns a
`DOMHighResTimeStamp`, measured in milliseconds.

**Usage**

```js
let start = performance.now();


// code to be timed...


let duration = performance.now() - start;

```

Let’s begin testing…

## Test Results

According to our tests, here are the results in ascending order;

So, according to these results, the fastest way to iterate through JavaScript
Objects is the **for…in loop**. Now, this doesn't mean the other methods are
void or useless, it all depends on use cases.

The problem with a `for...in` loop is that it iterates through properties in the
Prototype chain. It iterates over object properties. Javascript arrays are just
a specific kind of object with some handy properties that help you treat them as
arrays, but they still have internal object properties and you don't mean to
iterate over these. `for...in` also iterates over **all enumerable properties
** and not just the array’s elements. This can also lead to unexpected results.

When you loop through an object with the `for...in` loop, you need to check if
the property belongs to the object. You can do this with `hasOwnProperty`.

A better and more efficient way to loop through objects in ES6 is to first
convert the object into an array using `Object.keys()` , `Object.values()` ,
`Object.getOwnPropertyNames` or `Object.entries()` . Then you loop through the
array to get the keys and values.
